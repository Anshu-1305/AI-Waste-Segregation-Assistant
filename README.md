# 🌍 AI-Based Waste Segregation & Recycling Awareness Assistant

## 📌 Project Overview
An intelligent conversational AI assistant that helps users understand proper waste segregation and disposal methods. The system classifies waste into categories (wet, dry, recyclable, hazardous) and provides clear, actionable guidance aligned with environmental sustainability goals.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Improper waste segregation is a major challenge affecting environmental sustainability and efficient recycling processes. A lack of awareness among people about correct disposal methods leads to increased landfill waste, pollution, and health hazards. This project addresses these challenges through AI-powered education and guidance.

## ✨ Key Features
- **AI-Powered Classification**: Intelligently identifies waste types from user queries
- **Real-time Guidance**: Provides immediate, clear disposal instructions
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Modern, intuitive web-based application
- **Waste Categories**: Wet, Dry, Recyclable, and Hazardous waste classification
- **No Data Collection**: Privacy-first approach with no personal data storage
- **Educational Focus**: Promotes awareness and sustainable practices

## 🌍 UN SDG Alignment
- **SDG 12**: Responsible Consumption and Production
- **SDG 11**: Sustainable Cities and Communities

## 🤖 AI Classification System
The system classifies waste into four main categories:

### 1. **Wet Waste (Organic)**
- Food scraps, vegetable peels, fruits, leaves
- Disposal: Compost bin or organic waste facility

### 2. **Dry Waste**
- Paper, cardboard, cloth, newspaper, magazines
- Disposal: Dry waste bin for recycling centers

### 3. **Recyclable Waste**
- Plastic, glass, metal, aluminum, tin cans
- Disposal: Recyclable waste bin for material recovery

### 4. **Hazardous Waste**
- Batteries, electronics, chemicals, paint, medicines
- Disposal: Specialized collection centers and e-waste facilities

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Enter your waste disposal question (e.g., "Where should I throw batteries?")
3. Click "Ask AI" or press Enter
4. Receive instant disposal guidance

### Example Queries
- "How do I dispose of plastic bottles?"
- "What should I do with food waste?"
- "Where can I throw old electronics?"
- "How to segregate waste correctly?"

- **Response Formatting**: Clear, organized, multi-line responses
- **Error Handling**: Suggests local guidelines for unknown items

## 📝 How It Works
```
Step 1: User enters a waste-related question
Step 2: System analyzes keywords in the input
Step 3: Matches against waste classification categories
Step 4: Retrieves relevant disposal guidance
Step 5: Displays formatted response with specific instructions
```
